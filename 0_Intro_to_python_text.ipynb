    "- The first part, `import pandas`, does exactly what it says. It brings the pandas tools into our current notebook so that we can use them.\n",
    "- The second part, `as pd`, lets us refer to pandas by typing `pd` instead of `pandas`. This shortcut is not required, but it is very common and popular. Programmers often like to cut down on typing by making names very short. \n",
    "- When you run this code, it will import pandas, but it won't show us any output (unless there is an error), because we have not asked it to show us any output. Computers are very literal: they do exactly and only what we tell them to.\n",
    "- There are several ways to run the code in a \"cell\" (those grey boxes with code in them). First, click anywhere inside the cell. Then you can either click the â–¶ button near the top left of the page, or you can press [shift]+[enter] to run that cell and jump to the next one. \n",
    "    - Before a cell has been run, it will say `In [ ]:` on the left, indicating that this is a cell where you **in**put code.\n",
    "    - While the code in a cell is running, that is, when the computer is doing what the code tells it to, it will say `In [*]:` on the left.\n",
    "    - After the code in a cell has finished running, it will say something like `In [1]:` or `In [2]:`. The number is the order in which that code ran. So 1 was run first, then 2, and so on. If you run a cell a second time, its number will update to the latest number. \n",
    "    - If the code produces some output for the user to see, below the cell a new box will be created and labeled `Out [x]:`, where `x` is the number of the input cell that generated it. "
