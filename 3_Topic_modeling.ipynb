    "    - It has both LDA and NMF\n",
    "    - It is the same API they'll use for many stats and ML tasks\n",

    "- Steps \n",
    "    - preprocessing (use 'clean' data from lab notebook 1)\n",
    "    - fitting LDA\n",
    "    - viewing, interpreting topics\n",
    "    - cross tabs of topics and personal attributes of interest\n",
    "    - fitting NMF\n",
    "    - viewing, interpreting results\n",
    "    - comparing LDA & NMF topics (deal with alignment)\n",
