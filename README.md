# CSSLabs-NLP

Natural Language Processing labs for computational social science courses. 

## Requirements

* python3
* pandas
* nltk
* matplotlib
* numpy
* bs4
* re
* sklearn
* scipy

This lab uses the OKCupid data set available at [https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid]. The `okcupid_codebook.txt` and `profiles.csv.zip` should be downloaded and unzipped into the `data` directory.


## Optional
* These notebooks were created with the [Collapsible Headings](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/collapsible_headings/readme.html) Jupyter Notebooks extension. This makes some of the instructions look better, but the notebooks work fine without it. Installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).
