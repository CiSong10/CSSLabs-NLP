# User Guide for CSS NLP Lab Notebooks

## 0. Getting the Code and Data
To use these labs, you will need to download the code and the data. These are available for free online in two separate GitHub repositories. You **must** download both repositories.

#### Repositories
- **Code** https://github.com/UM-CSS/CSSLabs-NLP
- **Data** https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid

#### Download a repository from GitHub
- If you are familiar with `git`
    - We recommend you clone each repo.
- If you are unfamiliar with `git`
    - Easiest option:
        - Press the ![Clone or Download](images/clone_or_download.png "Clone or Download") button on the right side of each repository.
        - Choose `Download ZIP` and save the file somewhere memorable.
        - Go to where the file is saved and unzip it.

#### Putting the data in its place
These labs use data from Journal of Statistical Education Paper on Using OkCupid Data for Data Science Courses. We do not want to host or distribute this data, which is why we asked you to get it from the authors' Github page above. Now you need to put this data somewhere our code can find it. Steps:
1. Open the JSE_OkCupid folder that you downloaded.
2. Unzip the file `profiles.csv.zip`.
3. Copy the unzipped file `profiles.csv`.
4. Open the folder `CSSLabs-NLP`.
5. Within that folder, open the folder `data`.
6. Paste the `profiles.csv` file into the `data` folder.
